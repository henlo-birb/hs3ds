Wait a minute. You click and click, but nothing happens. This path selection screen seems to be broken. Looks like \"free will\" got greedy and overloaded the thing with \"choice\", rendering the graphic up there completely useless, except you guess as a cool rollover thingy. For the first time EVER, in the over 9000 page history of this website, you begin to feel slightly deceived. Oh, how you would have loved to taste the fruit of free will one last time before this wild ride jerks our bodies to a deadly stop. Alas it is not to be. You must proceed through all of these options linearly, one by one. You click the link below, as usual.",
