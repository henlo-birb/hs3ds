Everything works correctly. The sprites are prototyped, the battlefield can evolve, the Forge is present, Skaia can gestate a new universe... theoretically.",

But events conspire such that this never happens. Basically the players are doomed to fail.",

Then there's a void session, which is the same as a null session, but without even having the potential for success.",

Nothing is prototyped. The battlefield doesn't evolve. There's no Forge. It is completely inert.",

It has no chance of bearing fruit, at least not without some sort of miraculous external intervention. Like a deus ex machina.",

And then there's a dead session, which is a void session but worse. It's started by a single player. The kernelsprite collapses into a black hole, sucking the planet into it, and eventually the sun and entire solar system. There is no hope of creating a universe in such a session under any circumstance, not even with outside help. Victory and defeat in a dead session are dictated by totally different terms.",
